# Chase Spencer's Interactive Resume V2
This project is a rewrite using React of my first interactive resume where I used Angular. That code can be found here: https://github.com/NSpencer4/chasethedeveloper.

## TODO List
- [x] Install eslint with strict rule sets
- [x] Setup CI pipeline using Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Actions
- [x] Setup NextJS SSG config
- [] Install and configure Husky to enforce Conventional Commits
- [] Convert the Angular based chasethedeveloper.com to be React based
- [] 100% unit test coverage
- [] 100% integration test coverage
